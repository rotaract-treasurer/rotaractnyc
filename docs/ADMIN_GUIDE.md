When a cycle is created, dues records are generated for all active members.

### Viewing All Member Dues

The Manage tab shows a **table of all members** with their payment status for the current cycle:

**Q: A form isn't accepting responses.**
A: Check:
- Status is **"Active"** (not Draft or Closed)
- The auto-close date hasn't passed
- If "Limit one response" is on, they may have already submitted

A: Verify:
1. Service account key is set in environment variables
2. Calendar is shared with the service account email
3. Calendar ID is correctly entered on the admin page
