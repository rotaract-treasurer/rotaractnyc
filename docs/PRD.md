# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Rotaract Club at the United Nations – Website & Member Portal

## 1) Document Overview

**Product name:** Rotaract Club at the United Nations Website & Member Portal
**Organization:** Rotaract Club at the United Nations – NYC
**Prepared for:** Club leadership / website development team
**Document purpose:** Define the goals, scope, features, workflows, and success criteria for the club’s public website and member portal.

---

## 2) Product Summary

The Rotaract Club at the United Nations website will serve two core purposes:

1. **Public-facing presence** to showcase the club, its mission, leadership, events, impact, and partnership opportunities.
2. **Private member portal** to support club operations, improve member engagement, simplify dues management, centralize documents, and create a more modern, professional member experience.

The platform should feel polished, credible, and easy to use. It should help the club present itself professionally to prospective members, partners, and sponsors, while also giving current members a functional home base for participation.

---

## 3) Background & Problem Statement

The club needs a central digital platform that goes beyond a simple informational website. Today, member information, dues, event participation, club documents, and communications may be spread across different tools and informal processes. This creates friction for both leadership and members.

### Current problems

* No single polished digital hub for the club
* Club information, resources, and updates may be fragmented
* Dues collection can be manual and hard to track
* Member engagement is difficult to sustain between meetings/events
* New member onboarding lacks a structured digital flow
* Leadership may not have an easy way to manage attendance, documents, and communication from one place
* Public-facing brand presence may not fully reflect the quality and professionalism of the club

### Why this matters

A stronger website and portal can improve member retention, operational efficiency, transparency, and the overall prestige of the club.

## 13) Prioritization

## Phase 1 – MVP

Must-have for launch:

* Public website pages
* Member login/authentication
* Dashboard
* Member profiles
* Directory
* Dues status and payment flow
* Events + RSVP
* Announcements
* Documents library
* Admin member management

## Phase 2

* Attendance tracking improvements
* Committee pages and role-specific views
* Automated reminders for dues and events
* Better reporting / exports
* Improved onboarding workflow

## Phase 3

* Deeper analytics
* Member achievements / engagement scoring
* Integrated email tools
* Photo galleries by event
* Sponsor portal or partnership workflow
* More automation across operations

---

## 14) Risks and Considerations

* Members may not regularly use the portal unless it is genuinely useful
* Too many features at launch may slow development and reduce polish
* Dues workflows must be clear and reliable to avoid confusion
* Privacy settings are important for member directory trust
* Admin interfaces should remain simple enough for board turnover each year

### Mitigation

* Focus MVP on high-utility features
* Design around recurring member needs: dues, events, updates, directory
* Use clean permissions and simple admin controls
* Make onboarding and login friction low

---

## 15) Open Questions

* Will membership applications happen directly through the site or through an external form initially?
* Which payment processor will be used for dues?
* What member information should be visible in the directory?
* Should there be different permissions for board, committee leads, and general members?
* Will event attendance be manual, QR-based, or RSVP-based only?
* Should past members / alumni be included in the directory?
* Should the portal include committee collaboration spaces later?
* Should email notifications be built in now or added later?

---

## 16) Recommended MVP Decision

For the first strong version, the website should prioritize the following:

* A premium public-facing website
* A clean member dashboard
* Directory
* Dues tracking/payment
* Event RSVP
* Announcements
* Document library
* Simple admin controls

This combination gives the club a real operational upgrade without making the first version too heavy.

---

## 17) Forms & Surveys (Custom Data Collection)

### Overview

Admins can create custom forms and surveys directly in the portal — replacing the need for external tools like Google Forms. Each form gets a clean, shareable link (`/f/post-event-survey-2026`) and all responses are collected, viewable, and exportable from within the portal.

### Capabilities

* **Form Builder** — visual field-by-field builder with 12 field types:
  * Short text, Long text, Email, Phone, Number, Date
  * Dropdown, Multi-select, Single choice (radio), Checkboxes
  * Star rating, Numeric scale (1–10)
* **Field configuration** — labels, placeholders, helper text, required toggle, custom options
* **Reorder fields** — move fields up/down in the builder
* **Form settings:**
  * Allow anonymous or require name/email
  * **Require login** — gate form behind member authentication (Google sign-in); respondent identity is auto-filled from their member profile and duplicate responses are tracked by UID
  * Limit one response per person (by email or UID when login required)
  * Progress bar toggle
  * Custom confirmation message
  * Optional redirect URL after submission
  * Auto-close date
* **Status lifecycle** — Draft → Active (live, accepting responses) → Closed
* **Shareable links** — clean `/f/{slug}` URLs, auto-generated from title
* **Link to events** — optionally tie a form to a specific event
* **Response dashboard** — table view of all responses with respondent info
* **CSV export** — one-click export of all responses to CSV
* **Delete responses** — remove individual responses from the admin view

### Use Cases

* Post-event feedback surveys
* New member onboarding questionnaires
* Volunteer signup forms
* Committee interest forms
* RSVP extensions with extra questions
* Partner/sponsor inquiry collection
* Anonymous suggestion boxes

### Data Model

* **`forms`** collection — stores form definition, fields, settings, slug, status
* **`formResponses`** collection — stores individual submissions linked by `formId`

### Access Control

* **Create / Edit / Delete forms** — Board, President, Treasurer roles only
* **View responses / Export** — Board, President, Treasurer roles only
* **Submit responses** — anyone with the link (public), or restricted to authenticated members when "Require login" is enabled

---

## 18) Future Vision

Over time, the platform can become the club’s full operating system: a place where members join, pay dues, engage with events, access documents, stay informed, and feel connected to the club community. It can also strengthen the club’s external brand and make leadership transitions smoother year after year.
